  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p> My name is Andrew Rodriguez and I am a 4th year undegrad majoring in business administration. </p>
  <p> I am taking this course as a part of my ITM specialization, and looking forward to learning how to develop a website. </p>
  <p> I am not sure if I am coding this correctly, but I'm sure we will learn as we carry out the course </p>
  <p> I followed the lectures with a test repository, and managed to publish a website with the random things I wrote in the index file. I think I understand the push/pull configuration well. </p>
  <p> The browsers I have installed on my PC are Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. I also installed notepad++, and installed the compare plug-in that we will use later in the course. I will try to validate this website once it is published and send a screenshot.</p>
